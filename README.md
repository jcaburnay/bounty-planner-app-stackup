# Planner App â€“ Your Custom Widget (Bounty)

## About This Bounty

In the Planner App quest of the Web Development with React II campaign, released on the same day as this bounty, you created a planner app with several widgets.

In this bounty, you will be required to create your own custom widget. If you are not able to think of one, here is a list of ideas you can use for your custom widget:

* Weather Widget
* Location Widget
* Stopwatch Widget
* game, e.g.tic tac toe
* Photo Widget

You will also be required to have a write-up of at least 100 words describing why you think your custom-made widget is an appropriate widget to have in the planner app, and also how to use it. The write-up can be either a PDF or Markdown file. You should ensure that the file can be accessed by our reviewer.

## Acceptance Criteria

Submissions will be judged based on the following criteria:

1. Appropriateness of the widget: Does the custom widget built fit in with the rest of the widgets of the planner app?
1. Comprehensiveness of the write-up: Does the write-up clearly explain why the widget was built and how it works?
1. Code Quality: Does the code follow the best coding practices and is easy for other developments to understand?
